<li>Football</li>  
<P>My biggest hooby is of playing football. Once during my childhood, my elder brother show me a game of manchester united vs manchester city. That was the day, I found Cristiano Ronaldo whom I admire. 
    He has been my biggest inspiration. I usually play in the role of midfield. I was envolved in the group Kathmandu-FC and have won various trophies with them.

<li>Reading books</li>
<p>My another favourite leisure time task is of reading books. Till the date I have read several Nepali and international books. Some of my favourites writers are Paulo colleho, Subin Bhattarai, J.K. Rolling. 
    My all time best book is the Alchemist. During the holidays during pandemics, I read more than 15 books. Due to huge knowledge about books sometimes, I think of writing my own book.
